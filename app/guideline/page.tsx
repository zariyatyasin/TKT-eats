        Welcome to TheKitchenTable!
      </h1>
      <p>
        We are excited to have you on board. These detailed guidelines will help
        you deliver excellent services and ensure that every client has a
        wonderful experience. Please take the time to review everything
        carefully.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold">1. Service & Cleanliness</h2>
      <p>
        At the end of every service, you must clean the kitchen and any pots,
        pans, or utensils you used. The client is responsible for cleaning
        plates and handling leftovers. If there are leftovers, educate the
        client on how to store and reheat them properly so the dish retains its
        quality.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold">
        2. Using Client&apos;s Kitchen Equipment
      </h2>
      <p>
        You are allowed to use the client&apos;s kitchen tools like pots, pans,
        and basic ingredients (e.g., oil, salt, pepper). However, you must ask
        for permission before using any of their items. Please do not assume
        that the client will have everything you need for the meal. Always bring
        your own specialized tools or ingredients. Over time, we will start
        gathering more data about clients&apos; kitchens. This will help you
        better prepare for each service, knowing what tools or ingredients the
        client is likely to have.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold">3. Ingredient Preparation</h2>
      <p>
        We recommend bringing extra ingredients with you in case something goes
        wrong during the cooking process. To save time, you are welcome to
        prepare up to 50% of the meal at home and finish cooking at the
        client&apos;s home. If you prefer to cook the entire meal in front of
        the client, you are free to do so.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold">
        4. Menu & Special Client Requests
      </h2>
      <p>
        Your profile features an a la carte menu to showcase what you offer,
        including your pricing and the cost of ingredients. If a client has
        specific requests outside of your menu, they can reach out to us through
        a special profile. We will then work together with the client and chef
        to create a custom meal plan that meets their needs.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold">5. Client Interaction</h2>
      <p>
        Building rapport with clients is important. Keep the conversation
        friendly and professional. Ask questions such as: “What&apos;s your
        favorite dish?” “Have you tried something like this before?” Share your
        love of cooking, and explain the process as you go along. This helps
        clients appreciate the craft behind their meal. Make sure to educate
        clients on how to store and reheat any leftovers so they can enjoy them
        later.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold">
        6. Travel & Transportation Costs
      </h2>
      <p>
        You will be reimbursed $0.25 per mile for round-trip travel between your
        home and the client&apos;s location. Ensure you calculate your mileage
        carefully to ensure accurate reimbursement.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold">7. Payment Process</h2>
      <p>
        For now, payments are handled through Venmo, Zelle, or CashApp, but we
        are working to integrate Stripe into our platform soon. Each chef will
        receive a unique URL to create their Stripe account, making tracking
        payments simple and secure. We no longer require a 25% down payment.
        Instead, full payment (including tips) will be transferred to you within
        24 hours after the service is complete. If you experience any issues
        with payments, please contact us directly, and we will work with you
        individually to resolve the situation.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold">8. Bringing Ingredients</h2>
      <p>
        Whenever you bring ingredients to a client&apos;s home, make sure to
        bring extra supplies in case of emergencies. In the future, we will
        introduce a checklist feature in the app to make ingredient tracking
        easier. This will allow you to check off items you already have,
        simplifying preparation for each service.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold">
        9. Meal Plans, Special Diets, & Budget Planning
      </h2>
      <p>
        In addition to a la carte services, some clients may request meal plans,
        special diets, or budget-friendly options. These services are unique and
        will require close collaboration between you, the client, and our
        platform. The client&apos;s budget will be provided to you, and you will
        need to create a menu that fits within that budget. We will work
        together to ensure the client gets the best value while maintaining
        high-quality food.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold">
        10. Future Features & Platform Updates
      </h2>
      <p>
        We are working on several new features to improve your experience,
        including: In-app notifications so you are always up-to-date with client
        requests. Chat functionality within the app, so you can communicate
        directly with clients without needing to go through us. Ingredient
        checklists to help you keep track of items needed for each service. The
        ability to add or remove menu items easily from your profile.
      </p>

      <p>

        you succeed as a chef while providing the best possible experience for
        our clients. Let&apos;s work together to create memorable meals and

          preferences, let us know in advance so we can ensure the chef
